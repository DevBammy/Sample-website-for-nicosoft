          <div class="col">
            <h3>What is a Webinar?</h3>
            <p>
              A webinar is an online seminar that turns a presentation into a
              real-time conversation from anywhere in the world. Webinars allow
              large groups of participants to engage in online discussions or
              training events and share audio, documents or slides – even when
              they’re not in the same place as the meeting host or in the same
              room where the event or presentation is taking place.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h3>What is a Podcast?</h3>
            <p>
              Simply put, a podcast is an audio file posted on a website that
              people can download and listen to. Businesses use them to
              establish themselves as experts in their field or to share
              information about their product or service.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>What are the advantages of webinars?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Webinars are an increasingly popular way to build relationships with
          current and potential clients. They are multi-media meetings, seminars
          or classes held over the Internet and done in real time.
        </p>
        <div class="what">
          <div class="col">
            <h4>1. Webinars allow you to interact with your audience.</h4>
            <p>
              Because webinars are “face-to-face,” you get to talk to and not
              just at your audience. And you can allow them to talk back to you
              as well as get feedback from them.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h4>2. Webinars have engaging multi-media features</h4>
            <p>
              A podcast only has one form of media: audio. Webinars, on the
              other hand, have audio and video. This allows you to show your
              audience rather than just tell them. Unlike a podcast, you can
              also allow your audience to be seen and heard at your discretion.
              Your webinar can be listen-only, discussion, Q&A or private
              depending on your goals for the webinar.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h4>3. Webinars allow you to earn money on the spot.</h4>
            <p>
              Paid Webinars allow you to monetize your expertise. You can now
              make money by having people pay to attend your webinar. They pay
              and receive an access key, which will allow them to log in when
              your webinar begins. Use this feature for your very best webinars,
              those that provide the best material and are value added to your
              audience.

                Usually, we’d need at least one week’s notice so we can
                adequately prepare for a live stream. However, certain times of
                the year are busier than others so don’t leave it too late!

                If you’re planning on using a hired venue for a webinar or live
                stream then sound (microphones & in-room PA) will sometimes be
                provided. However, if you’re planning using one of your own
                locations we’ll need to allow for sound technicians.

                you. If you have a contract with a webinar or virtual event
                platform we’re happy to plug our production in your account.
